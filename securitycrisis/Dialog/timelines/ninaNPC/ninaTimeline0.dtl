Nina: Hi hi, [color=red]Welcome to the Cyber Defence Hub[/color]!
Nina: Let me give you a quick rundown of what we do here.
Nina: Inside this hub, you can purchase any unlocked defences — as many as you need.
Nina: But keep in mind, each purchase will cost you [color=red]Knowledge Points[/color].
Nina: You’ll be able to earn more Knowledge Points in various ways as you progress, but for now, let me give you a starting bonus.
Nina: Since we’re defending against a DDoS attack, I’ve added Firewalls to your inventory.
Nina: Purchase as many as you need, and then dive into the [color=red]Cyber-World[/color]!
