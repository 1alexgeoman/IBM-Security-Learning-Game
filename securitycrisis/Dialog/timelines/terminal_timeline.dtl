Captain: Welcome to the [color=red]Cyberworld[/color].
Captain: In the Cyberworld, you can deploy cyber defences purchased from the Cyber Defence Hub. These will be used to protect the [color=red]Reactor[/color] from destruction.
Captain: If you successfully defend against the threats, you’ll be awarded Knowledge Points — which you’ll need for future rounds.
Captain: We already have some defences in place, but for this round, we’ll also need Firewalls to counter the DDoS attack.
Captain: Once all defences are set, click [color=red]Start[/color] to begin the round.
